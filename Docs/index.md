# OLAP Data Connector

The OLAP connector lets you fetch data from multidimensional databases like Mondrian, Microsoft Sql Server Analysis Services (SSAS), etc.

## Setting up the connection and data source

Most of these databases support the XMLA protocol and can be accessed via webservice. Follow the [instructions here](setup/index.md) to set up the server and create a connection in the meta model.
